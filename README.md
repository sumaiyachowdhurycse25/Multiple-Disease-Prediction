  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p> This project focused on diagnosing different diseases and identifying the 
risk factors and causes. The aim is to build models with higher accuracy 
which considers all the symptoms of the diseases that are important. In this project, 
the diseases are Stroke, Heart disease, Parkinson, Diabetes, Breast Cancer, 
Thyroid, Chronic Kidney disease and Brain Tumor. 7 machine learning algorithms have been implemented to build models with higher accuracy</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
 <h3>For Diabetes</h3>
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the parameters - Pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes 
Pedigree Function and Age. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the 
best model to detect whether the patient has diabetes or not. </p>
 <br>
  <h3>For Kidney Disease</h3>
  
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the 
parameters - Age, Blood Pressure, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Sugar Red Blood Cells, Pus 
Cell, Pus Cell Clumps, Bacteria, Blood Glucose Random, Blood Urea, Serum Creatinine, 
Sodium, Potassium, Hemoglobin, Packed Cell Volume, White Blood Cell Count, Red 
Blood Cell Count, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Coronary Artery Disease, Appetite, 
Pedal Edema and Anemia. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the 
best model to detect whether the patient has kidney disease or not.   </p>
<br>
 <h3>For Stroke</h3>
  
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the parameters - 
Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Married, Residence Type, Average Glucose 
Level, BMI and Smoking Status. The performance of the models have been analyzed to 
get the best model to detect whether the patient will have stroke or not.   </p>
<br>
 <h3>For Breast Cancer</h3>
  
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the 
parameters - Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, 
Concave Points, Symmetry and Fractal Dimension. The performance of the models have 
been analyzed to get the best model to detect whether it is malignant or benign.   </p>
<br>
<h3>For Parkinson</h3>
  
  <p> Different machine learning models have been built based on the parameters - Average Vocal Fundamental Frequency, Maximum Vocal Fundamental Frequency, 
Minimum Vocal Fundamental Frequency, Several Measures of Variation in Fundamental 
Frequency, Several Measures of Variation in Amplitude, Two Measures of Ratio of Noise 
to Tonal Components in the Voice, Two Nonlinear Dynamical Complexity Measures, 
Signal Fractal Scaling Exponent and Three Nonlinear Measures of Fundamental Frequency 
Variation. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the best model to 
detect whether the patient has parkinson or not.   </p>
<br>
<h3>For Thyroid</h3>
  
  <p> Different machine learning models have been built based on the parameters - Age, Sex, On Thyroxine, Query on Thyroxine, On Antithyroid Meds, Sick, Pregnant, 
Thyroid Surgery, I131 Treatment, Query Hypothyroid, Query Hyperthyroid, Lithium, 
Goitre, Tumor, Hypopituitary, Psych, TSH Measured, TSH Level, T3 Measured, T3 Level, 
TT4 Measured, TT4 Level, T4U Measured, T4U Level, FTI Measured, FTI Level, TBG 
Measured and TBG Level. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the 
best model to detect whether the patient has thyroid or not. </p>
<br>
<h3>For Heart Disease</h3>
  
  <p> Different machine learning models have been built based on the 
parameters - Age, Origin, Sex, Chest pain type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum 
Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting Electrocardiographic Results, Maximum Heart 
Rate Achieved, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to 
Rest, The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment and Number of Major Vessels .The 
performance of the models have been analyzed to get the best model to detect whether the 
patient has heart disease or not.</p>
