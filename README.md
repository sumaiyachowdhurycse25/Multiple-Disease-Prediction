  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p> This project focused on diagnosing different diseases and identifying the 
risk factors and causes. The aim is to build models with higher accuracy 
which considers all the symptoms of the diseases that are important. In this project, 
the diseases are Stroke, Heart disease, Parkinson, Diabetes, Breast Cancer, 
Thyroid, Chronic Kidney disease and Brain Tumor. 7 machine learning algorithms have been implemented to build models with higher accuracy</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
 <h3>For Diabetes</h3>
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the parameters - Pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes 
Pedigree Function and Age. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the 
best model to detect whether the patient has diabetes or not. </p>
  <h3>For Kidney Disease</h3>
  <p>Different machine learning models have been built based on the 
parameters - Age, Blood Pressure, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Sugar Red Blood Cells, Pus 
Cell, Pus Cell Clumps, Bacteria, Blood Glucose Random, Blood Urea, Serum Creatinine, 
Sodium, Potassium, Hemoglobin, Packed Cell Volume, White Blood Cell Count, Red 
Blood Cell Count, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Coronary Artery Disease, Appetite, 
Pedal Edema and Anemia. The performance of the models have been analyzed to get the 
best model to detect whether the patient has kidney disease or not.   </p>
